    <h1>Shallow Copy</h1>
    <br>
    A shallow copy creates a new object, but the properties inside it still reference the same memory locations as the original object. If the original object contains nested objects, modifying them will reflect in both copies.
    <hr>
    <h1>Deep Copy</h1> 
    <br>
    A deep copy creates a completely independent copy, including all nested objects. Modifications in one object wonâ€™t affect the other.
    <hr>
    <h1>Hoisting</h1>
    Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning you can call the function before its actual declaration.
    <br>
    Variables declared with var are hoisted but only their declarations, not their initial values.
